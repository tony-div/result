# result.js
handle your expected errors with a clean, fast approach
## why?
a [benchmark](https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-05_typescript-errors-vs-exceptions-benchmarks) shows that returning an object is 355.18x faster than throwing exceptions, and I really like the way rust [handles errors](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html)
